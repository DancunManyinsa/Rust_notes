# My Rust Notes

Summary notes of things I learn as I work on picking up Rust. Initially mostly
from [The Rust Programming Language book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), 
more specifically the excellent [Brown University version](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/)
that contains more interactive features. I augment it with some personally
material picked up from the [library documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/)
and any other stuff I pick up.
