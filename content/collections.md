# Common Collections

Collections are data structures that can contain multiple values. Unlike the
array and tuple types, data collections point to is stored on the heap, which
means that they can grow or shrink as the program runs.

The most commonly used collections are `String` type (a UTF-8 encoded, growable
string), `Vec` (a contiguous growable array type) and `Hashmap` (allows us to
associate arbitrary keys with an arbitrary value).
